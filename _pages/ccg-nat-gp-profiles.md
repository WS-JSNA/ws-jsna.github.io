Public Health England (PHE) produce [National General Practice Profiles](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/general-practice) using data from a variety of different sources. These profiles aim to support CCGs, Local Authorities, and GP practices to ensure they are providing and commissioning appropriate healthcare services for their population.

The profiles include information on:

1. Local demographics

2. [QOF](http://content.digital.nhs.uk/qof)

3. Cancer services

4. Child health

5. Patient satisfaction (using [the GP patient survey](https://gp-patient.co.uk/))

Profiles can be viewed for each individual practice, as well as summary profiles for CCGs. Comparisons for each practice can be made against England and CCG, and can also be viewed with the practice deprivation decile.
