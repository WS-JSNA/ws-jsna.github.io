The following questions concern ease of access to each GP surgery in Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG.

Respondents to the GP Patient Survey were asked to rate how easy they found it to get through to their surgery on the phone (*very easy* to *not at all easy*), how helpful the receptionists at the surgery were (*very helpful* to *not at all helpful*), and how often they were able to see or speak to the GP of their choice (*always, or almost always* to *Never or mostly never*).

The figures show the proportion of respondents who:

- felt it was **easy** to get through to someone on the phone
- felt that the receptionists at their surgery were **helpful**
- felt that they saw the GP of their preference **most of the time**

Note that the number of patients taking part in the survey varies by practice. Wide confidence intervals suggest smaller sample sizes and therefore less certainty in the results.
