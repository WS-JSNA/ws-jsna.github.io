The resources provided here are created by a number of different organisations (e.g. NHS Digital (formerly HSCIC), Public Health England) to help understand the needs of our local population. This can include resources to describe the quality of healthcare services and health related outcomes, comparisons with similar CCGs or areas, as well as wider determinants of health and wellbeing.

These resources have not been produced by the West Sussex Public Health and Social Research Unit, and we are not responsible for their release or data quality.
