The information in this profile has been grouped by GP registered population for the localities of Horsham and Mid Sussex Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) as shown in the map below. Where this is not possible, information is grouped by local authorities in the Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG region. This includes the whole of Mid Sussex and part of the local authority of Horsham.<br />

Horsham district is covered jointly by the Coastal West Sussex CCG and Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG boundaries. Where Horsham data is presented, this represents the whole of Horsham and not just the area covered by Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG.<br />
