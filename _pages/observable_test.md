This is a test of embedding [Observable workbooks](https://beta.observablehq.com/) in the [West Sussex JSNA website](https://ws-jsna.github.io).

I forked this example and am now attempting to embed it in this page using the plugin for Jekyll that I wrote, inspired by [this post by @Fil at VisionsCarto](https://visionscarto.net/observable-jekyll/).

{% include observable_notebook username="ws-jsna" workbook_name="d3-connected-scatterplot" key="1a54e3d79ca909d6" target="chart" %}
