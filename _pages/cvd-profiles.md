The Cardiovascular Disease profiles are an overview of data on cardiovascular and cardiovascular related conditions of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease. The profiles are for commissioners and health professionals when assessing the impact of cardiovascular disease on their local population and making decisions about services. They include data on mortality, hospital admissions, procedures and disease management. The profiles are created and maintained by the National Cardiovascular Intelligence Network (NCVIN).

Profile reports are available for each clinical commissioning group (CCG) in England.
