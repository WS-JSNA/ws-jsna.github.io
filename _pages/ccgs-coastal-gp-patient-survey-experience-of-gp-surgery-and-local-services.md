The following questions concern the overall experience patients have at their GP surgery in Coastal West Sussex CCG.

Respondents to the GP Patient Survey were asked to rate if they would recommend their GP surgery to someone who has just moved to the local area (*Yes, would definitely recommend* to *No, would definitely not recommend*) and to rate the overall experience of their GP surgery (*very good* to *very poor*). Respondents who reported long-term conditions were also asked to rate if they felt that they had had enough support from local services or organisations to help manage their long-term health condition/s in the past 6 months (*Yes, definitely* to *No*).

The figures show the proportion of respondents who:

- would **recommend** their surgery to someone who has just moved to the local area
- felt that the overall experience of the GP surgery was **good**
- felt that they have had **enough support** from local services to help manage long-term health condition/s

Note that the number of patients taking part in the survey varies by practice. Wide confidence intervals suggest smaller sample sizes and therefore less certainty in the results.
