A good start in life is fundamental to lay the foundations for good health and wellbeing in later life. Investment in well-designed, targeted early yearsâ€™ interventions produce returns which consistently outweigh their cost, and often exceed the benefits of interventions delivered during the later stages of life.

The West Sussex Public Health and Social Research Unit have reviewed local and national evidence and engaged with families and professionals to identify how the needs of children under the age of 5 are currently being met in West Sussex.

A full list of the recommendations from the report are presented in a summary infographic:
