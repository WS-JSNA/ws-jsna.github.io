### What is a PNA?

Since 1 April 2013, every Health and Wellbeing Board (HWB) in England has had a statutory responsibility to publish and keep up to date a statement of the need for pharmaceutical services of the population within its area. This is referred to as a Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA). The PNA:

+ looks at the current provision of pharmaceutical services across the West Sussex HWB area;
+ assesses whether service provision meets the current and future needs of the population and;
+ identifies any potential gaps to service delivery.

The PNA is a key document which is used by:

+ NHS England to inform decisions about applications for new, or changes to existing pharmaceutical services, and the commissioning of NHS-funded services that can be provided by local community pharmacies.
+ Local authorities and Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG) when commissioning services to meet local health needs and priorities.
