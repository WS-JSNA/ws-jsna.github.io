<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit the West Sussex Pharmaceutical Needs Assessment (PNA) survey page. The PNA looks at the current and future pharmaceutical service needs of the people in West Sussex and identifies any potential gaps to service delivery.</p>
<p>West Sussex County Council was conducting surveys to better understand local views on pharmaceutical services across West Sussex. The patient/public survey is now closed. Thank you for taking part. The findings from the survey will be used to inform the PNA. There will also be an opportunity to comment on the draft PNA during the consultation period in the near future, so please keep an eye out for it.</p>
