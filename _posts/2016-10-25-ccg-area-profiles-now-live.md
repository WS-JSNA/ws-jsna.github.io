The West Sussex Public Health and Social Research Unit have now completed the annual population profiles (formerly data packs) for the three Clinical Commissioning Groups in West Sussex:

* [NHS Coastal West Sussex CCG](/ccgs/coastal/)
* [NHS Crawley CCG](/ccgs/crawley/)
* [NHS Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG](/ccgs/horsham/)

These profiles are a powerful tool to examine variations in the health and wellbeing of people across West Sussex, and can help commissioners identify potential priorities for change.

The 2015/16 profiles have been redesigned to help users access information as quickly as possible on the web. To view the pages please click [here](/ccgs/) or use the links above.
