Tobacco−free living helps people live healthier for longer by reducing a person's risk of developing tobacco related diseases. Tobacco remains the single major cause of preventable ill−health and death.</p>
<p>Tobacco control is a scientifically proven program that seeks to address the preventable ill-health, death, disability and other consequences of tobacco use.</p>
