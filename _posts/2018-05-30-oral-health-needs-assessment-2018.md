How would you like to contribute to improving the oral health of children in West Sussex?

West Sussex County Council has drafted the 2018 West Sussex Oral Health Needs Assessment and is looking to obtain feedback and comments. The current draft has been developed by the West Sussex Public Health Directorate with the support of Public Health England and Jackie Sowerbutts, Dental Public Health Consultant.

We would value your input to help shape the document and contribute to the recommendations which will be used to inform an Oral Health Improvement Strategy.

Please direct any comments or feedback to [Louis.Hall@westsussex.gov.uk](mailto:Louis.Hall@westsussex.gov.uk).

We look forward to hearing from you.
