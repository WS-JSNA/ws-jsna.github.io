<p><b>NHS Digital have released the <a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=23381&q=national+child+measurement+programme&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1#top" target="_blank">National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP)</a> results for the 2015/16 school year. </b><br />
<br />
Children in reception class (aged 4 to 5 years) and year 6 (aged 10 to 11 years) have their height and weight measured to assess overweight and obesity levels in children within state-maintained primary schools. This data is used at a national level to support local public health initiatives and inform the local planning and delivery of services for children.<br />
<br />
The West Sussex Public Health and Social Research Unit have completed a <a href="http://jsna.westsussex.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Final-Data-Briefing-1516-National-Child-Measurement-Programme.pdf">data briefing (NCMP: 2015/16)</a> to summarise childhood obesity prevalence at a local level.</p>

<p></b></p>
<ol style="list-style-type:circle">
<li>In England, <b>over a fifth</b> of reception children were overweight or obese, and in year 6 it was over a <b>third</b>. Nationally, the prevalence of obesity has <b>increased</b> since 2014/15 in both reception and year 6</li>
<p></p>
<li>In West Sussex, prevalence of obesity was <b>lower than national</b>, but not regional levels; with 19.9% of reception age children (4-5 years old) and 30.4% of year 6 children (10-11 years old) measured as overweight or obese</li>
<p></p>
<li>Within local authorities, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is varied. For both school years, there was no significant change in the percentage of overweight/obese children for any one local authority within West Sussex compared to the previous year.</li>
