NHS Digital have released the [National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP)](http://content.digital.nhs.uk/searchcatalogue?productid=23381&q=national+child+measurement+programme&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1#top) results for the 2015/16 school year.

Children in reception class (aged 4 to 5 years) and year 6 (aged 10 to 11 years) have their height and weight measured to assess overweight and obesity levels in children within state-maintained primary schools. This data is used at a national level to support local public health initiatives and inform the local planning and delivery of services for children.

The West Sussex Public Health and Social Research Unit have completed a [data briefing (NCMP: 2015/16)](/assets/core/Final-Data-Briefing-1516-National-Child-Measurement-Programme.pdf) to summarise childhood obesity prevalence at a local level.

### Key Facts

+ In England, **over a fifth** of reception children were overweight or obese, and in year 6 it was over a **third**. Nationally, the prevalence of obesity has **increased** since 2014/15 in both reception and year 6.

+ In West Sussex, prevalence of obesity was **lower than national**, but not regional levels; with 19.9% of reception age children (4-5 years old) and 30.4% of year 6 children (10-11 years old) measured as overweight or obese.

+ Within local authorities, the prevalence of overweight and obesity is varied. For both school years, there was no significant change in the percentage of overweight/obese children for any one local authority within West Sussex compared to the previous year.
