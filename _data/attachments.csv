The briefing provides an estimate of the number of children living in West Sussex who have a disability and outline the sources of data and background to the assumptions made. This information is important to aid the planning of services and support to children, young people and their families.

There is no single definition of disability and therefore providing a single accurate estimate is difficult; for example the 2011 Census definition of disability is: ‘A long-term health problem or disability that limits a person’s day-to-day activities, and has lasted, or is expected to last, at least 12 months’; the Family Resources Survey (FRS) uses a different definition: ‘a long-standing illness, disability or impairment which causes substantial difficulty with day-to-day activities’. Estimating the number of children and young people according to “severity” or in terms of specific needs or conditions is also problematic.

* There should be an increased emphasis on recovery. As a matter of urgency there should be clear linkages with maternity services, specialist inpatient services and some specialist adult social care.
* There should be increased provision, and improved mapping, of peer support and self-help groups.
* There should be stronger integration with mental health services to ensure that the needs of people with a dual diagnosis are addressed.
* Commissioners should examine the access and take up of services by people from diverse groups, including BME groups, and people living in rural areas.
* Examine why there is apparent under-use of some services, including the Structured Day Service and the local residential Tier 4 detox and rehab service.
* Commissioners should review the assessment panel process for Tier 4 and also ensure that that Tier 4 treatment options should be considered at the start of a treatment journey not as Òthe last resortÓ.
* Work should be undertaken to improve staff wellbeing and morale, including sickness and stress levels.

Nationally, the population of older adults is projected to increase. The number and proportion of older people continues to rise, with over 11.6 million people (17.8% of the population) in the UK aged 65 and over and 1.5 million (2.3% of the population) aged 85 and over in mid-2015.

West Sussex has a large and growing population of older adults. If population growth projections are correct, the number of adults aged 65+ that are projected to require hospital treatment for a fall will almost double by 2039.
