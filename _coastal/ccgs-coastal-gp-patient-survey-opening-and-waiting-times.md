The following questions concern opening and waiting times for each GP surgery in Coastal West Sussex CCG.

Respondents to the GP Patient Survey were asked to rate how satisfied they were with the opening hours of their GP (*very satisfied* to *very dissatisfied*), and how they feel about the waiting times at their surgery (*don't normally have to wait too long* to *have to wait far too long*).

The figures show the proportion of respondents who:

- were **satisfied** with the opening times of their GP surgery
- and how they **feel** about the length of the waiting times at their surgery

Note that the number of patients taking part in the survey varies by practice. Wide confidence intervals suggest smaller sample sizes and therefore less certainty in the results.

**Satisfaction with Opening Times**
