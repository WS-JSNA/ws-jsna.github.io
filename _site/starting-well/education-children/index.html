<h3 id="SACE19">Analysis of the West Sussex 2011 Year 11 cohort</h3>
<p class="page__meta">Date added: 24/08/2012</p>
<p>This report looks at educational attainment of Year 11 Pupils in 2011 at Key Stage 4 (GCSE) along with pupil progress in core subjects (English, Maths and Science) between Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 4.</p>

<p>79% of students achieved 5+ A<em>-C grades in all subjects, while 59% of students achieved 5+ A</em>-C grades when including English and Maths.</p>

<p>This is similar to the national figures but compares averagely with neighbouring counties.</p>

<p>The results also show that there is a strong correlation between social deprivation and educational attainment, particularly for Maths and Science.</p>

<p>Variations in attainment were also observed between districts with a higher percentage of pupils from Horsham achieving grade A*-C compared to pupils in Adur.</p>

<p>Exclusion from school either temporarily or permanently is associated with poorer attainment. Pupils that have been excluded (between September 2007 and December 2010) were 3 times less likely to achieve 5+ A*-C grades (including English and Maths) compared to non-excluded pupils.</p>
