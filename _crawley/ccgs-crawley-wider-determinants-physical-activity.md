Physical inactivity is the 4th leading risk factor for global mortality, accounting for 6% of deaths globally. People who are physically active are less likely to suffer a stroke, heart disease, or cardiovascular disease and reduce their risk of  obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes (among others).

### Guidance

The current age specific NHS guidelines on physical activity levels are:

#### Early Childhood (Under 5s)

- Babies should be encouraged to be active from birth. Before your baby begins to crawl, encourage them to be physically active by reaching and grasping, pulling and pushing, moving their head, body and limbs during daily routines, and during supervised floor play, including tummy time. Once babies can move around, encourage them to be as active as possible in a safe, supervised and nurturing play environment.
- Children who can walk on their own should be physically active every day for at least 180 minutes (3 hours). This should be spread throughout the day, indoors or outside.
- Children under 5 should not be inactive for long periods, except when they are asleep.

#### Children Aged 5-18

- At least 60 minutes (1 hour) of physical activity every day, which should be a mix of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, such as fast walking, and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, such as running.
- On three days a week, these activities should involve muscle-strengthening activities, such as push-ups, and bone-strengthening activities.

#### Adults Aged 19-64

- At least 150 minutes (2 hours 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity such as cycling or fast walking every week, and muscle strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). OR
- 75 minutes (1 hour and 15 minutes) of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity such as running or a game of singles tennis every week, and muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). OR
- An equivalent mix of moderate-and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity every week (for example 2 30 minute runs, plus 30 minutes of fast walking), **and** muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms)

#### Adults Aged 65 and over

- At least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity such as cycling or fast walking every week, **and** muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). OR
- 75 minutes (1 hour 15 minutes) of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity such as running or a game of singles tennis every week, **and** muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). OR
- An equivalent mix of moderate and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity every week (for example two 30-minute runs plus 30 minutes of fast walking), **and** muscle-strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). 


### Physically Active Adults

Data on physical activity is collected via the Active People Survey; a survey commissioned by Sport England. This is the largest national survey into physical activity levels and sports participation. Data are published at local authority level. The figure shows the percentage of adults aged 16 and over who have participated in at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week in bouts of 10 minutes or more in the previous 28 days.

Generally, there has been little change in the percentage of adults who are physically active in Crawley. Overlapping confidence intervals show no significant difference in the proportion of physically active people in Crawley compared with England or West Sussex, with 57.5% of respondents to the Active People Survey participating in the recommended amount of physical activity in the preceding month.

### Physically Inactive Adults

Sport England also provide statistics on the prevalence of physical inactivity. This is defined as the percentage of adults (age 16 and over) who have participated in less than 30 minutes of at least moderate physical activity per week in bouts of 10 minutes or more in the previous 28 days.

The chart illustrates the physically inactive adult prevalence rate across local authorities in Coastal West Sussex. Overlapping confidence levels suggests little difference across areas and years.
