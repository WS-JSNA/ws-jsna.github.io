### Population Estimates

Population information is available in different formats depending on the definition used. The **registered population** is defined as the number of people registered with a GP *regardless of where they live* and the **resident population** is defined as the number of people *residing in a particular geographical area* (e.g. a district).

The GP registered population for Crawley CCG in July 2016 is 130,600. Crawley CCG has more people aged up to 14 years and between 25-59, and less people in the 60+ age groups.
