Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, tightness of chest, and wheeziness.

The graph below shows a breakdown of QOF (Quality Outcomes Framework) information for each locality (distinguished by colour) with each bar representing an individual practice. Each bar represents the percentage of people on GP registers compared to the modelled estimates for the condition. A value below 100% suggests that fewer people registered at a GP are recorded with that condition than the modelled prevalence estimates, and a value over 100% suggests that the prevalence of people registered at a GP exceeds the modelled prevalence of people with that condition at that surgery.

Comparing the registered with the predicted prevalence provides an estimate of an unmet, or undiagnosed need within the local population. It should be noted that prevalence figures are produced by applying nationally researched assumptions to each GP practiceâ€™s population and, as such, should be treated with some caution.

The figure shows that the QOF prevalence of asthma for most GP surgeries in NHS Crawley CCG is smaller than the modelled prevalence.
