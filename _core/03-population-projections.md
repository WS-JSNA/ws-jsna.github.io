## Population projections
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) produce population projections as an indication of the future size and age structure of the population based on mid-year estimates and assumptions around future fertility, mortality and migration.

The ONS population projections for West Sussex districts year on year from 2011 to 2021. These use rates from pre the census 2011 and do not include housing supply constraints and as such should be used with caution.
