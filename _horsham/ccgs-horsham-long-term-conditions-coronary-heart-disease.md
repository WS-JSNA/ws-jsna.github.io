Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) is a leading cause of death in the UK. The main symptoms of CHD include heart attacks and heart failure. Evidence for the management of the symptoms of CHD is well established, and if implemented can reduce risk of death and improve quality of life.

The graph below shows a breakdown of QOF (Quality Outcomes Framework) information for each locality (distinguished by colour) with each bar representing an individual practice. Each bar represents the percentage of people on GP registers compared to the modelled estimates for the condition. A value below 100% suggests that fewer people registered at a GP are recorded with that condition than the modelled prevalence estimates, and a value over 100% suggests that the prevalence of people registered at a GP exceeds the modelled prevalence of people with that condition at that surgery.

Comparing the registered with the predicted prevalence provides an estimate of an unmet, or undiagnosed need within the local population. It should be noted that prevalence figures are produced by applying nationally researched assumptions to each GP practiceâ€™s population and, as such, should be treated with some caution.

The figure shows that the QOF prevalence of CHD for all GP surgeries in Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG is smaller than the modelled prevalence.
