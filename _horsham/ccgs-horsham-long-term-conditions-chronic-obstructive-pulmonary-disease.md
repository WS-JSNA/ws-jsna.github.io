Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the name for a collection of lung diseases (such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema). People with COPD have difficulties breathing, coughs, and are prone to chest infections due to the narrowing of their airways.

The graph below shows a breakdown of QOF (Quality Outcomes Framework) information for each locality (distinguished by colour) with each bar representing an individual practice. Each bar represents the percentage of people on GP registers compared to the modelled estimates for the condition. A value below 100% suggests that fewer people registered at a GP are recorded with that condition than the modelled prevalence estimates, and a value over 100% suggests that the prevalence of people registered at a GP exceeds the modelled prevalence of people with that condition at that surgery.

Comparing the registered with the predicted prevalence provides an estimate of an unmet, or undiagnosed need within the local population. It should be noted that prevalence figures are produced by applying nationally researched assumptions to each GP practiceâ€™s population and, as such, should be treated with some caution.

The figure shows that the QOF prevalence of COPD for all of the GP surgeries in Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG is smaller than the modelled prevalence.
