### Population Estimates

Population information is available in different formats depending on the definition used. The **registered population** is defined as the number of people registered with a GP *regardless of where they live* and the **resident population** is defined as the number of people *residing in a particular geographical area* (e.g. a district).

The GP registered population for Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG in July 2016 is 236,600. Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG has fewer people aged 0-4 years and aged 15-34, and more people aged 35+ compared with the resident population of England. Comparison between the registered population and resident population in Horsham and Mid Sussex CCG (as shown in the table below) shows that there are higher numbers of people in the registered population for older age groups than the resident population.
